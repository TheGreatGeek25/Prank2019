# Plain English Markup Language

All files are sequences of paragraphs.
Each paragraph is a sequence of statements, the first of which is preceded by a single tab character.
The first few statements in a paragraph can be modifiers that apply to the whole paragraph.
The rest of the paragraph are elements with modifiers.

~~I don't want to write any more documentation~~ The rest is self-explanatory.
